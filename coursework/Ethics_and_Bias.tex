% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf

% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the

% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE

% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:

\subsection{Motivation and Overview}
As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly used in various fields, its widespread adoption raises pressing ethical concerns, notably bias. As a leading member of the development of emotion recognition software, it is my responsibility to evaluate the ethical implications of the software.

This paper looks at the importance of Ethical Impact Assessments (EIA's) in software development. Through an EIA, I’ll show practical steps for addressing potential risks and harms. The paper concludes with recommendations for both technical and non-technical aspects of software development.


\subsection{The Algorithm}
The initial prototype of the software will use two main data sources. The AffectNet database will be used due to it having over 450,000 facial expression images, each annotated with an emotion\cite{DatabasePaper}. Additionally, we plan to acquire data from Meta or Google to further develop the model. If this secondary source of data doesn’t come pre-labelled, our initial action will be to organise teams to accurately categorise the images.

The algorithm is designed to predict the emotions of individuals in real time based solely on their facial expressions. Initially, the beta version will generate text, describing the detected emotions, as well as an accuracy score. Future versions will offer diverse input and output formats.

The software is a versatile AI tool. It will be designed to recognise human emotions through facial expressions. Modified versions can serve various applications, from enhancing road safety by monitoring driver focus and alertness for governments and traffic authorities, to aiding psychologists in diagnostics, and equipping marketing teams with a tool to gauge consumer preference for sales optimisation. 

Making the software publicly available should be done with caution. Misuse or bias could reinforce stereotypes and discrimination. There would also be a higher risk of data breaches, highlighting the need for the development team to focus on ensuring the systems are secure.

\subsection{Ethical Impact}
Ethical implications should be addressed early for both the company’s reputation and society’s welfare. Particularly bias and discrimination. Ensuring that our algorithm is free from discrimination is vital.

Ethical Impact Assessments are crucial, they help us predict and address potential issues before they happen. By considering the impact of our work on stakeholders, we will foster more positive relations with them, including clients and the public. This will have a positive impact on the company at large.



\subsection{The Value Sensitive Design Approach}
The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach is an approach based on theoretical principles for the design of technologies while accounting for human values that are deemed important\cite{Friedman2009Value}\cite{BiasAndVSD}. This approach considers these principles throughout the design and implementation stages. VSD is ideal for this project because it allows us to develop our software responsibly and ethically while aligning with the company’s core values. Furthermore, adopting the VSD will improve Public Trust and Relations by demonstrating our commitment to ethical practices while ensuring that the software meets the technical standards.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Analysis of the Key Value Conflicts}
I identified human values using various sources, including \textit{Batya Friedman’s Value Sensitive Design and Information Systems}, discussing the importance of Privacy, Trust, Consent, Accountability and Public Trust\cite{Friedman2009Value}. These values are vital to consider harbouring a sense of trust and security towards the software. \textit{Zhisheng Chen’s Ethics and Discrimination in artificial intelligence-enabled Recruitment Practices} concludes persistent algorithmic bias is due to historical data \cite{Discrimination}.

Fig.2 highlights the importance of considering ethical values before the software development stage. If collaborators prefer less disclosure, conflict could arise between Public Trust and Transparency. Prioritising public trust will ensure the sustainability and longevity of the company while demonstrating commitment to ethical responsibility. Privacy and Transparency may also conflict. Here, Privacy must be prioritised while ensuing that transparency regulations are met. 


\section{Recommendations and Considerations}
\subsection{Motivation and Recommendations}
From the EIA, I found critical areas for further investigation and action to ensure the software is developed responsibly and ethically. I propose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Privacy - a common concern for many stakeholders. Thus, this will be the top priority. Ensure a team is rigorously testing security.
    \item Input from the stakeholders - Could be useful, either conduct meetings with stakeholders of use surveys to gather input.
    \item Data manipulation - During data preparation, the identification and mitigation of bias in the data is crucial. To ensure that minority groups are represented, techniques such as synthetic data generation and weighted sampling should be used.
    \item Consent – Attempt to inform users on how their data is used. Provide a brief overview and display it to users in an easy to digest format.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Datasets}
The datasets used should be free from all bias in an ideal world, however, this usually isn’t the case. The article \textit{Discrimination, Bias, Fairness, and Trustworthy AI by Daniel Varona and Juan Luis Suárez} highlights the struggle with standardising variables that are essential for creating trustworthy AI systems, making it difficult to incorporate trustworthiness into business models \cite{TrustworthinessAI}. We should consider that even with sufficient data cleaning, the software may not be void of bias. To make a completely fair model we risk having a low accuracy and efficiency.

There are existing datasets available such as the AffectNet database (discussed in part 1.2). However, the datasets contain mainly images. The software should work on real-time video, so we would need to organise a team to collect more data in the form of videos. This would be a laborious and expensive task due to the time taken to collect sufficient data and the storage space required. To ensure the mitigation of bias in the data collection, we should let the subjects self-diagnose their emotions. The data collectors should be unaware of the purpose of data collection to prevent unconscious bias and we should ensure that the dataset includes a diverse range of faces.

\subsection{Risk and Bias Mitigation Methods}
Harm to individuals and groups should be mitigated, or at least minimised, as much as possible. We should aim to improve the safety, fairness and equity of the system and promote responsible and ethical development. I will discuss a few tools/techniques/methods to do so for this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As mentioned in section 3.2, data collection should be diverse.
    \item Regularly auditing algorithms using fairness metrics can be used to identify and measure bias. A toolkit like AI Fairness 360 should be employed to assess the model[insert source]. This solution connects with the Fairness, Bias and Discrimination sections of the EIA. This can minimise the damage caused by biased software, thus improving the fairness and equity of the system.
    \item 	Involving stakeholders that could be affected in the design and evaluation process. Inviting stakeholders to comment and add extra values that they find important could be useful\cite{Lecture9}.  Their input and suggestions could be used in the design process. This solution connects with the Transparency and Public Trust of the EIA. This can demonstrate the team’s willingness to learn from the public while exhibiting openness.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Critical Assessment and Limitations}
Limitations associated with the proposed methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 	Privacy can never be fully guaranteed online as there is almost always a possible security fault that can be breached.  However, making it as difficult as possible should be sufficient. 
    \item 	Meetings with stakeholders would be time consuming. However, for this task it would be useful to do so.
    \item 	We risk compromising the model’s accuracy by artificially manipulating the dataset. It is a suitable method to use, if done cautiously.
    \item 	Many users will choose to ignore the overview of data usage. This is difficult to mitigate and so may require additional thought for a better solution.
    \item 	Collecting video data would be a laborious and expensive task due to the time taken to collect sufficient data and the storage space required. To ensure the mitigation of bias in the data collection, we should let the subjects self-diagnose their emotions. The data collectors should be unaware of the purpose of data collection to prevent unconscious bias and we should ensure that the dataset includes a diverse range of faces.
\end{itemize}



\section{Summary and Final Remarks}
To briefly summarise this paper, we first defined the problem and looked at the importance of EIAs and the VSD approach. I then showed my EIA along with an analysis. Finally, using the EIA, I highlighted my recommendations and considerations. I hope this article has been informative and useful in the design and implementation stages of the development of our software.
